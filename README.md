# Metrics

A simple, Scala-based framework for extracting data and exporting it to JSON
and/or CSV. Convenient for making data that Web/JS visualizations use or
for users relying on tools such as JMP, R, Excel, etc.

## Key Features

- Data exports to CSV and JSON
  * CSV exports are "flat", meaning simple and succinct. Intended for Excel, JMP, R, and ilk
  * JSON exports have the full graph of data, such as values for histogram bins
- Errors don't cause exports to blow up nor will nonsensical default values be exported (e.g. 0 or -1 for a number)
  * CSV cells show a blank if a value couldn't be calculated
  * JSON exports omit failed values. Pushes error handling to JS or viz tool
- Convenience methods for writing succinct code without any data serialization boiler plate required

## Usage

This is an API. It doesn't run on its own other than to provide tests and coverage.

```
# Build a JAR
sbt clean coverage test coverageReport

... 
[info] Statement coverage.: 100.00%
[info] Branch coverage....: 100.00%
[info] Coverage reports completed
[info] All done. Coverage was [100.00%]
```

See [TestMetrics in MetricsSpec.scala](src/test/scala/falkner/jayson/metrics/MetricsSpec.scala)
for an example that tests all of the features. Below is brief example
showing how data is serialized.

```
# Make a `Metrics` instance to have it be serialized
class Example extends Metrics {
  override lazy val values: List[Metric] = List(
    Str("Name", calcName),
    Num("Age", calcAge),
    Dist("Data", calcContinuousDist(Seq(0f, 1f, 0.5f), nBins = 3, sort = true)),
    Num("Borken", willThrowError)
  )
    
  val willThrowError = () => throw new Exception("Calculation failed!")
  val calcName = () => "Data Scientist"
  val calcAge = () => "21"
}

# Export as CSV for JMP, R, Excel, etc. Notice the error doesn't break the export.
# Also notice that the data is flat and omits histogram bins.
CSV(Paths.get("example.csv", new Example())

# example.csv 
Name,Age,Data: Samples,Data: Bins,Data: BinWidth,Data: Mean,Data: Median,Data: Min,Data: Max,Borken
Data Scientist,21,3,3,0.33333334,0.5,0.5,0.0,1.0,

# Export as CSV for fully serialized data, convenient for Web/JS or data viz tools.
JSON.export("example.json", new Example())

# example.json
{
  "Name": "Data Scientist",
  "Age": 21,
  "Data": {
    "Min": 0.0,
    "Mean": 0.5,
    "Max": 1.0,
    "Bins": [1, 1, 1],
    "BinWidth": 0.33333334,
    "Samples": 3,
    "Median": 0.5
  }
}
```

## Suggested Versioning Conventions

These are helpful conventions to follow for supporting common use cases. These examples assume you are using
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), but any version string can be used in a similar fashion.

### Use 'Code Version' and 'Spec Version"

Make metrics modules that have a `build.sbt` version that is mirrored as the "Code Version" in a companion object, and
also have a "Spec Version" that represents the version of the underlying file format you are parsing. Together these
give a way to later sort data based on if the metrics code was updates and/or if the underlying data format changed.

An example of this can be seen in `MetricsWithVersion` and `MetricsWithVersion_1_2_3` [here](https://github.com/jfalkner/metrics-examples/blob/e7a8a22acac87fc2b66b3cbfd01dd2e7fae20ae1/src/main/scala/falkner/jayson/metrics/example/MetricWithVersions.scala#L44-L45) in the `metrics-examples` repo.

### Use and object with `apply` to encapsulate version parsing logic

The main strategy is as simple as capturing the version detecting logic in an `apply` method of an object, which serves
as the entry point to parsing data. An example is in `MetricsWithVersion` [here](https://github.com/jfalkner/metrics-examples/blob/5f769f9fc46ed3234569b5a2ae572b994eeb4a6b/src/main/scala/falkner/jayson/metrics/example/MetricWithVersions.scala#L29-L37) in the `metrics-example` repo.

### `blank` for making CSV headers

Having a val named `blank` that is a `null` or otherwise no-arg created instance of the current `Metrics` is required 
for making headers in CSV exports, namely `View` instances. With a `blank` you can easily make a view that is just a
copy of all values.

An example of `blank` is in `MetricsWithVersion` [here](https://github.com/jfalkner/metrics-examples/blob/618210b4d9ad5dc1ec9798c3653f67e02d64dd8e/src/main/scala/falkner/jayson/metrics/example/MetricWithVersions.scala#L29) in the `metrics-example` repo.
